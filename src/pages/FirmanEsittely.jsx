                Broken Code Games is a small indie game developement studio located in Finland. Year 2016 marked the first time we published a game called Hollow Halls on online gaming platform Steam, after successfully passing through Greenlight qualification. We operated on shoestring budget and enthusiasm and ambitions that are more often than not in conflict with what is feasible and what we are capable of during the developement of Hollow Halls, but things have changed since.
                <br/>
                The biggest change that has happened since the time we worked on Hollow Halls, is that on top of the financial and technical issues we had before, we have now added issues of rather limited amount of time we have at our disposal for working on our current game, now known as Project Vesiraukka.
                <br/>
                Despite the cards being stacked against us, we strive to move forward with our game project, going through failure after another without losing enthusiasm. As one admiral or prime minister once said, that's what success is made of.

                <h1>Our company policy:</h1>
                <br/>
                - There will never be any DRM in any Broken Code Games product. We see them only as a temporary 2 hour obstacle for piratees, while being a lifetime bother and hinderance for people who legitimately obtained the game.
                <br/>
                - Broken Code Games will not persecute people who pirate our games or who distribute pirated version of our games. If you ever get a legal consequence for pirating Broken Code Games products, it is not made by us, but another party. We are still grateful if you buy our game legitimately, as it enables us to make better games in the future and improve existing ones.
                <br/>
                - The company will never be subverted from doing games our own way or pushing political agenda other than our own into our games.
                <br/>
                - Death is preferrable alternative to communism.
